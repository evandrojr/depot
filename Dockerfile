# See https://github.com/phusion/passenger-docker/blob/master/Changelog.md for

FROM phusion/passenger-full:<VERSION>
# Or, instead of the 'full' variant, use one of these:
#FROM phusion/passenger-ruby19:<VERSION>
#FROM phusion/passenger-ruby20:<VERSION>
#FROM phusion/passenger-ruby21:<VERSION>
FROM phusion/passenger-ruby22:2.2.2
#FROM phusion/passenger-jruby17:<VERSION>
#FROM phusion/passenger-nodejs:<VERSION>
#FROM phusion/passenger-customizable:<VERSION>

# Set correct environment variables.
ENV HOME /root

# Use baseimage-docker's init process.
CMD ["/sbin/my_init"]

# If you're using the 'customizable' variant, you need to explicitly opt-in
# for features. Uncomment the features you want:
#
#   Build system and git.
RUN /pd_build/utilities.sh
#   Ruby support.
#RUN /pd_build/ruby1.9.sh
#RUN /pd_build/ruby2.0.sh
#RUN /pd_build/ruby2.1.sh

#RUN /pd_build/jruby1.7.sh
#   Python support.
#RUN /pd_build/python.sh
#   Node.js and Meteor support.
#RUN /pd_build/nodejs.sh

# ...put your own build instructions here...

# Clean up APT when done.
